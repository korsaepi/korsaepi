- 💞️ Pronouns: She/her
- 🌱 I'm a master's student at the University of Cambridge interested in understanding the interactions between the linguistic infusion of Konglish and English aquisition in Korea. I'm looking to find correlations between Konglish usage, sentiment towards English, and methods/quality of English aquisition.
