- 👋 Hi, I’m @korsaepi (aka Saffron)
- 💞️ Pronouns: She/her
- 🌱 I'm a master's student at the University of Cambridge interested in understanding the use of Konlglish and tracking whether this impedes or facilitates English acquisition in Korean learners. In tandem with this I enjoy exlporing sentiment towards English usage in formal scenarios such as public signage and transport.
