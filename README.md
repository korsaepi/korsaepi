- 👩‍💻 Hi, I’m @korsaepi (aka Saffron)

- Master's student at the University of Cambridge interested in understanding the use of Konglish and tracking whether this impedes or facilitates English acquisition in Korean learners. In tandem with this I enjoy exploring sentiment towards English usage in formal scenarios such as public signage and transport.
